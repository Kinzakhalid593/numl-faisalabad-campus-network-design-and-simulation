I designed and simulated a complex hierarchical network for the NUML Faisalabad campus using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, organized infrastructure and ensure seamless connectivity across multiple campus blocks.
<br>
• Implemented a hierarchical topology with Core, Distribution, and Access layers using Cisco 2911 routers and 3560 multilayer switches to manage inter-VLAN routing and campus-wide communication.
<br>
• Segmented departments into 10 VLANs (VLAN 10–100) for traffic isolation, including AI & CS (VLAN 80), Admin, Library, and Hostels.
<br>
• Configured DHCP and DNS servers to automate IP assignment and enable internal web and FTP services.
<br>
• Applied structured IPv4 Class C subnetting (192.168.x.0/24) for efficient IP management and organized device allocation.
<br>
• Simulated message flow, routing, and connectivity across the campus using Cisco Packet Tracer.
<br>
• Verified the network with ICMP ping and traceroute tests with 0% packet loss, ensuring full end-to-end connectivity and proper routing.
<br>
Outcome:
<br>
A fully functional, scalable campus network that demonstrates secure VLAN segmentation, reliable departmental communication, and practical network management with real-world server integration.
